# Weather Forecast Accuracy Comparison

Embark on a meteorological journey with my Weather Forecast Comparison project, where I scrutinize the accuracy of three prominent weather forecasting websites for Budapest, Hungary.

1. **OMSZ – Hungarian Meteorological Service**
   - [OMSZ Website](https://met.hu)
   - A government-operated site providing the official weather forecast for Hungary.

2. **Időkép**
   - [Időkép Website](https://www.idokep.hu/)
   - Another local and popular weather forecaster.

3. **Weather Underground**
   - [Weather Underground Website](https://www.wunderground.com/)
   - An international weather forecaster renowned for its global accuracy.

## Project Focus

Budapest Weather. I have collected comprehensive data on temperature, wind patterns, precipitation, and more from each site for both forecasted and actual weather conditions.

## Analyzing Accuracy

My goal is to assess the accuracy of short-term, mid-term, and long-term forecasts from each platform.

## Stay Tuned

The project is currently in progress, and results will be unveiled soon. I aim to provide you with valuable insights into which weather forecasting site excels in delivering the most accurate predictions for Budapest.
