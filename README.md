# Weather Forecast Comparison Project

Embark on a meteorological journey with my Weather Forecast Comparison project, where I scrutinize the accuracy of three prominent weather forecasting websites for Budapest, Hungary.

## Weather Forecast Websites

- **HungaroMet (previously OMSZ)**: [Hungarian Meteorological Service](https://met.hu) - a government-operated site providing official weather forecasts for Hungary.
- **Időkép**: [Időkép](https://www.idokep.hu/) - another local and popular weather forecaster (TOP10 most visited site in Hungary).
- **Weather Underground**: [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) - an international weather forecaster renowned for its global accuracy.

## Project Focus

Project Focus: Budapest Weather (between 15 June 2023 and 31 March 2024). I have collected comprehensive data on temperature (high and low) and precipitation.

## Analyzing Accuracy

My goal is to assess the accuracy of 1-6 days forecasts from each platform.
